## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This library easily allows you to use [Amino](https://aminoapps.com) API.
Notice that this library is not official AND according to [Narvii's TOS](https://narvii.com/tos.html) it is prohibited. You can get banned if you use this library.
The author is not responsible for the use of AminoJS.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Here will be some notes how to use AminoJS.

### Prerequisites

Firstly, you should have up-to-date [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version. Do not forget to install [NPM manager](https://www.npmjs.com/).

### Installing

After installing Node JS and NPM, you should create your project. Just make a folder for your bot.
For example, we will create folder named "AminoJSBot".
Then you should open your CMD or Terminal and open this folder.

Open terminal and type

```bash
cd PATH_TO_YOUR_FOLDER
```

And then you need to install AminoJS package.

```bash
npm install @ilyadrmx/aminojs
```

NPM manager will download all files that you need.

### Setting bot folder

I recommend that you create a folder named "bot" inside of our "AminoJSBot" folder.
Then, inside of "bot" folder you should create two files:

- main.js
- config.js

So, we have a project structure like this:

```
AminoJSBot
¬¶    package-lock.json
¬¶    package.json
¬¶
+--- bot
¬¶       config.js
¬¶       main.js
¬¶       
L--- node_modules
     ...
```

### Creating simple bot

Firstly, let's login our bot. Open "main.js" file (/AminoJSBot/bot).
Now, let's import AminoJS library.

```js
const { Client, SubClient } = require("@ilyadrmx/aminojs");
```

So, we've imported library and now we need to make an instance of **Client** class.
It allows us to use Amino's global user features.

```js
const client = new Client(null, false); // Don't change if you don't know what is this
client.login("YOUR_EMAIL", "YOUR_PASSWORD"); // Here you should replace text
```

Lines that we've added above allows our bot to login.
Now we should to make an instance of **SubClient** class.
It allows us to use Amino's community user features.

```js
const client = new Client(null, false);
client.login("YOUR_EMAIL", "YOUR_PASSWORD");
    .then(() => { // .then() is necessary
        const subClient = new SubClient(client, "COM_ID");
    });
```
