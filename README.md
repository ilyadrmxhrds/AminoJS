## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Here will be some notes how to use AminoJS.

### Prerequisites

Firstly, you should have up-to-date [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version. Do not forget to install [NPM manager](https://www.npmjs.com/).

### Installing

After installing Node JS and NPM, you should create your project. Just make a folder for your bot.
For example, we will create folder named "AminoJSBot".
Then you should open your CMD or Terminal and open this folder.

Open terminal and type

```
cd PATH_TO_YOUR_FOLDER
```

And then you need to install AminoJS package.

```
npm install @ilyadrmx/aminojs
```

NPM manager will download all files that you need.

### Setting bot folder

I recommend that you create a folder named "bot" inside of our "AminoJSBot" folder.
Then, inside of "bot" folder you should create two files:

- main.js
- config.js

So, we have a project structure like this:

```
AminoJSBot
¦    package-lock.json
¦    package.json
¦
+--- bot
¦       config.js
¦       main.js
¦       
L--- node_modules
     ...
```
